CREATE A FOLDER NAMED "db" inside the main project directory
CREATE A FILE NAMED db.js inside the db folder

WITHIN DB:

1. npx knex init

    This will create a knexfile.js file. Here, we will have to provide MSSQL database configurations, like -
    server: "localhost",
    port: 1433,
    database: "DATABASE_NAME",
    user: "USERNAME",
    password: "PASSWORD"

2. npx knex migrate:make create_todo_table

    This will create a migration file. A migration is the process of creating tables and essentially just designing their schema. A schema of the tables refers to the columns that make up the table, the data types for each column, and the relationship a table may have with other tables in our database. Once we have our database configured, we should now create our migration file that will hold the schema of our table.

    We should now see a folder called ‘migrations’ and this will be the location of our table’s first migration and all the future migrations for the table.

    We can open the only migration file we currently see and take a look at the starter code. What we see is the structure for a migration, both exporting migrations up and down. We have to insert the code to create the table’s schema (up) and to revert the table back to its original state (down).

3. npx knex migrate:latest

    This will run the latest migration file and create the table in the MSSQL database.

4. npx knex seed:make 01_seed

    This will create our seed file and create some starter task to populate our table with some initial row object data. (CAUTION - DON'T PROVIDE VALUES FOR "id" COLUMN IN THE ROW OBJECTS, MSSQL WILL AUTOMATICALLY INSERT THE ID IN INCREMENTING ORDER)

5. npx knex seed:run

    THIS WILL EXECUTE THE TASK IN ABOVE FILE, THUS CREATING THE DATA ROWS IN MSSQL TABLE
